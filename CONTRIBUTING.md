# Contribution Guideline for the sas-econometrics-examples Repository

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Initial Contribution to GitLab:**
   - All contributions should be initially submitted to the team's GitLab repository. Contributors are encouraged to provide well-commented code, and comprehensive documentation, and follow consistent naming conventions.
   - Make sure to run all necessary tests and provide testing documentation if applicable.

2. **Repository Maintainer Review and Public Sync:**
   - The repository maintainer will review the changes, update the changelog, and synchronize them to the public GitHub repository (https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-econometrics-examples). Please note that acceptance and public synchronization are subject to review for consistency, quality, and adherence to the project's guidelines.
